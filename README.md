# PuzzleDemoGCL
This repository contains the code for "Solving Jigsaw Puzzles By the Graph Connection Laplacian" paper

We included the code for R. Yu, C. Russell, and L. Agapito, "Solving jigsaw puzzles with linear programming", under the folder PuzzleDemoLP, 
where we only added one function to make it suitable for our purposes.

To test the algorithm run the script "puzzle_GCL_test.m"

The function that takes as an input an image, creates a square puzzle out of with specified sizes and runs our algorithm on it.
